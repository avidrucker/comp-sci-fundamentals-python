please start the day by:
- click on the start icon in your virtual machine taskbar
- type "Jupyter Notebook"
- click on the software that comes up to open it
- I.E. will open up by default, you can close that
- a command line window will also open up, you MUST NOT close that EVER
- inside the command line window, please copy the address that looks like this & paste it into a Chrome window (I only added quotes for emphasis, you don't need quotes on yours) : 
"http://localhost:8888/?token=af6006ad5407149954bc0414ebef8491b236a78d932b9d79"
- your Chrome window should look like mine to the left
